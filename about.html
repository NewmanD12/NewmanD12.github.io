        <h1>Dakota Newman</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>First, I would like to introduce myself. I am Dakota Newman and I am 28 years old. I am married to my wonderful wife Krista and together we have 2 dogs. We have an English Bulldog whose name is Chubbs and a long haired Chihuahua named Chiboe. We are both from a small place in Fayette County, West Virginia but now we live in a little cowboy town named Pendleton, OR.</p>
        <!-- <p>My wife and I were both raised in Fayette County WV, and attended part of high school together. We later started dating in mid-2014 and got married in Sept of 2017, and the rest they say is history.</p>

          <h1>My Background</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>During my junior year of high school I had already made up my mind that I was going into the United States Air Foce. Three months after graduation, off I went to basic training. Coincidentally it was the first time I had ever been on an airplane also, talk about nervous!</p>
          <p>After basic training, I then went to technical school for the job that I had picked in the Air Force, an avionics technician. I spent time in Mississippi and Northern Texas afterwhich I got orders to my first base, RAF Lakenheath. This is where the fun actually began, and I began my journey as an F-15 avionics technician. </p>
